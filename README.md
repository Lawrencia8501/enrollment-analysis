# Analysis of Dual Degrees, Multiple Majors, and Minors at The University of Tulsa (TU)

This project analyzes the academic trends at The University of Tulsa (TU) by examining students pursuing dual degrees, multiple majors, and minors. The goal is to identify trends, determine the most and least popular academic choices, and compare TU's offerings with peer institutions. The findings will assist TU's marketing and recruitment strategies by highlighting the university’s academic flexibility.

## Project Objectives
- Understand Enrollment Trends: Identify the percentage of students pursuing multiple degrees and majors.
- Analyze Popularity by College: Examine the distribution of degrees and majors within TU's four colleges:
Arts & Sciences
Business
Health & Natural Sciences
Engineering & Computer Sciences
- Compare TU with Peer Institutions: Benchmark TU’s academic offerings with competitor universities.
- Support TU Scholars Program: Inform eligibility criteria based on degree and major distribution.

## Agile Project Management Framework
This project followed an Agile methodology to ensure flexibility, stakeholder collaboration, and iterative improvements.

## Sprint Planning & Weekly Stand-Ups
- Sprint Duration: 2-week cycles with clear deliverables.
- Weekly Stand-Up Meetings:
 Conducted with stakeholders (Executive director).

 Used for requirement gathering, feedback loops, and continuous refinement.


Prioritized using Jira for project tracking 


## Data Collection
- Source: TU student enrollment data from Fall 2020 to Fall 2024.
- Storage & Management: Utilized the SPRO module in Ellucian Colleague for data handling.
- Security Measures: Ensured data integrity and protection using Global Protect for network security.

## Data Processing & Analysis
### Data Cleaning
- Excel for Data Preprocessing:
(i) Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

(ii)Used Excel formulas (IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) to transform data.

(iii)Applied Pivot Tables for preliminary trend analysis.

- SQL for Data Transformation:
(i) Creating Views & Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to integrate multi-year data.

(ii) Unpivoting Data: Transforming wide-form data into a more analytical format.

(iii) Column Transformations: Standardizing major and degree names for consistency.

### Data Visualization & Insights
- Power BI Dashboards: Interactive visualizations displaying key trends.
- SQL-Based Queries: Extracting insights using subqueries, joins, and CTEs.
- Key Findings:
> 90% of students pursue a single degree.
>>87-89% of students prefer a single major.
>>>Double degree enrollments remained stable at 6-8% annually.
>>>>Triple degree enrollments were consistently below 1%.
>>>>>The College of Engineering & Computer Science and Arts & Sciences attracted the most students.
